# fcc - the feeble C compiler

fcc is a C to x86 compiler which supports a small subset of the C programming
language, including basic functions, variables, structs, expressions and
control flow.

Only the types `char` and `int` (both signed and unsigned) are currently
supported, as well as pointers to those types and pointers to `void`.
